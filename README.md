### Algorithms and Data Structures Visualizations (OFFLINE browsing)
#### "A picture is worth a thousand words" indeed!

#### Description:
[Algorithms and Data structures visualization](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/about.html) is interactive animations implemented with HTML5 / javascript and developed by [David Galles](http://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/contact.html).
He, kindly, made the source available under FreeBSD.<br/>
I used the files and source code to create a docset for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) to enjoy easy and searchable navigation of all the awesome animations OFFLINE.

#### Download and Use:
To use the docset, you need to install Dash (for Mac) or Zeal (for windows).<br>
Then, download the folder algorithms-visualized.docset and open it with the documentation browser you just installed.


+ (Mac OS) Dash is available to download for [free in the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dash/id458034879?ls=1&mt=12).
+ (Windows) Zeal, the alternative of Dash, is [available on github](https://github.com/jkozera/zeal).
+ Originally, Dash is an API documentation browser. However, since it is so aweosme, I generalized to knowledge browser :)
